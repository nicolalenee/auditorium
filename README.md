  ## Description:
  AlgoRhythm's mission is to help create a bridge of connection between venues and artists of all sorts within the music industry. We can even help create connections between artists themselves! AlgoRhythm believes that a community-focused approach best serves everyone in planning events that will bring enjoyment to all parties involved.
